# Message Lock
Lock your chat to a certain player with `/msglock <player>`! Unlock it by using just `/msglock`.

The chat is automatically unlocked when the player you locked on leaves the game, or when you leave the game.

To match Vanilla, other aliases are available: `/telllock`, `/wl`

Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
